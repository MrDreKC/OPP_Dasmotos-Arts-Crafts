Dasmotos Arts Crafts 1/12/2024

Hello, welcome back. Continuing on my journery to learn coding (specifically for Web Design/Development at the moment) I am back at Codecademy for this one in the form of another off-platform project 
which tasked me with building a simple website for a ficitonal arts & crafts store. And honestly huge confidence builder at a time where it feels like getting into this industy when more qualified indiviuals are
get fired from the jobs by the hunderds (twitch, google). 

But that knowledge aside this project really makes me feel like I am one: starting to get a handle on this whole Web Design/Development and two: that I might be able to make it in the industry. Just need to find someplace to 
somewhat ease me into it slowly and then just go from there.
